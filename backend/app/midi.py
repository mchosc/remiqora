"""Audio -> MIDI transcription (MuScriptor) for a saved track or one of its stems.

Unlike Demucs, MuScriptor isn't a CLI of its own: it is loaded into YuE2's
already-running audiocpp_server and driven over that server's REST API. Two
consequences shape this module:

* YuE2 must be the *active* model, otherwise there is no server to talk to
  (the route checks this and refuses up front rather than queueing a job that
  cannot run).
* "Cancel" can only abandon our side of the HTTP call - the server has no
  task-cancel endpoint, so its GPU work runs to completion either way. This
  matches how the frontend already cancels a YuE2 generation (AbortController).

One job per (track, source) pair: the full mix and each Demucs stem are
transcribed independently, each constrained to the instrument groups that
source can plausibly contain, and each written to its own .mid.
