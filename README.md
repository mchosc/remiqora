Reviewed upstream adaptations, preserved fork workflows and verification limits:
[October 2026 integration notes](docs/upstream-integration-2026-10-01.md).

This fork focuses on local music, voice and video creation: reliable singer preparation, retained audio sources and explicit export settings, persistent favorites, and recoverable jobs/projects. These features are implemented but experimental. CPU and mocked-model tests do not establish GPU quality, Windows support or a clean installation; the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) records the remaining verification. Installation and data integrity take priority over adding more models.

## Why this exists

ACE-Step and YuE2 are two independent music generation engines, each with its own web UI, its own result-storage format, and its own process that has to be started and stopped by hand. They typically cannot run simultaneously on a single consumer GPU. Remiqora solves this with a single layer on top:

- **One UI** instead of two different interfaces with different UX.
- **Mutually-exclusive orchestrator**: pick a model in the header — it starts up, and the other one stops on its own. No need to manually kill processes before starting the other engine.
- **Shared storage**: every track (generated, uploaded, or assembled in the editor) is tracked in a centralized SQLite database and shared folder, available from every module — Demucs, MuScriptor and the editor all work off the same library instead of three separate ones.
- **A DAW on top of generation**: a generated track isn't the end point, it's raw material — split it into stems, drag it onto a timeline, process it with effects, blend it with other tracks, and export.
- **Built-in LoRA training**: not just generation — fine-tune ACE-Step on your own voice or style right from the browser, no console needed.

---

## What's inside

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| **ACE-Step 1.5** | Fast generation from text/style tags, covers, section repainting, extracting/adding parts on top of a reference track. |
| **YuE2-3B** | Full-length track generation with CoT score planning (a symbolic ABC plan before the audio). |
| **SheetSage2** | Extracts melody and harmony from a reference track into ABC notation — used as YuE2's input. |
| **LoRA training** | Dataset → auto-labeling → preprocessing → training → export — the whole ACE-Step fine-tuning pipeline for your own voice/style, in the browser. |
| **Demucs** | Splits any track into 4 stems: vocals, drums, bass, other. |
| **MuScriptor** | Transcribes audio (the full mix or a single stem) into MIDI notes. |
| **Voice Clone** | Review singing samples, audition references and optional cleanup, build Seed-VC voices, and compare checkpoints on separately uploaded evaluation audio. See the [voice preparation guide](docs/voice-quality.md) for setup, workflow, and limitations. |
| **Built-in DAW** | A multitrack timeline editor for assembling tracks/stems into a final mix: an effects rack on every channel, auto-BPM and time-stretch, WAV/MP3 export. |

The interface is fully bilingual (Russian/English). It starts in your system language, and the switcher in the header overrides it.

---

## ACE-Step: generation

![ACE-Step: generation and track feed](docs/screenshots/en/02-ace-step.png)

Two input modes: **“Simple”** — a single text description the model uses to infer both style and lyrics on its own; and **“Custom”** — style tags with autocomplete plus lyrics with structure markup (`[Verse]/[Chorus]/[Bridge]`) and performance annotations (`(whisper)`, `(falsetto)`), or an “Instrumental” checkbox.

Use **Hide generator** to give the track list the full width, **Show generator** to restore the side card, or **Float generator** to open it above the list. Drag its title/header to move it, or focus the title and use arrow keys (Shift moves farther). Movement stays within the screen; **Dock generator** and **Hide generator** remain visible above the scrolling form. Escape inside it hides the panel after any open Help dialog is closed. Switching modes preserves the draft, selected file and floating position; only the panel mode is remembered after a page reload.

Attaching a reference track unlocks these scenarios:

- **Voice Replacement** — replace the singer with a ready cloned voice, keep a separate original upload and remix with the separated accompaniment. Uses Demucs/Seed-VC without generating a new song; see the [voice replacement guide](docs/voice-replacement.md) for limits and cancellation/retry behavior.
- **Cover** — restyle while keeping the melody (tunable original-preservation strength).
- **Repaint a section** — replace only a chosen part of the track.
- **Extract a part** — pull one instrument/voice out of a finished mix (12 options: vocals, drums, bass, guitar, etc.).
- **Add a part** — compose one missing instrument on top of the mix.
- **Finish the composition** — the same, but for a whole list of parts at once.

Plus: 10–300 s duration, batch of 1/2/4 variants, mp3/wav/flac formats, advanced parameters (BPM, key, time signature, vocal language, inference steps, guidance scale, seed), LoRA adapter support with adjustable strength, local presets, and a "Stop all" button for bulk job cancellation.

New ACE submissions retain the engine's WAV source and create the requested-format export with the profile captured from **Settings** at submission. Voice conversion retains its separate WAV output. See [audio export quality](docs/audio-export-quality.md) for explicit MP3/WAV/FLAC profiles and source-quality limits; higher export bit depth does not recover missing source detail. [Voice conversion status](docs/voice-conversion-progress.md) explains queue reasons, stages, elapsed time and measured stage estimates.

## YuE2 and SheetSage2: generation

![YuE2: generation and track feed](docs/screenshots/en/03-yue2.png)

Three **CoT (Chain-of-Thought)** modes: `off` — straight to audio; `melody` — the arrangement is built around a given melody (ABC); `full` — the model first builds a symbolic plan (melody + chords), then generates the audio.

**SheetSage2** lets you upload a reference track and pull its melody into ABC notation, right in the form, with one click — editable by hand afterwards. Beyond that: `q8_0`/`q4_0` precision, batch of 1–4, a full set of sampling parameters for audio generation and the ABC planner separately, local presets, and viewing/reusing the ABC score of an already-generated track.

## LoRA training (ACE-Step)

![LoRA training](docs/screenshots/en/04-lora-training.png)

The full ACE-Step fine-tuning pipeline on your own dataset, no console required:

1. **Dataset** — upload audio files straight from the browser (drag & drop) or point at an existing server folder, a trigger word, an "all tracks are instrumental" flag.
2. **Automatic labeling** — LLM-generated description, genre, BPM/key, lyrics transcription/reformatting.
3. **Review and edit** — a table of every sample where you can fix the description/genre/tags before training.
4. **Preprocessing** — converts labeled samples into tensors.
5. **Training** — LoRA rank/alpha/dropout, learning rate, epochs, batch size, FP8, gradient checkpointing, live progress with an ETA and a TensorBoard link.
6. **Export and registry** — the finished adapter is immediately added to the LoRA list on the generation form.

## Stem separation (Demucs)

![Stem separation](docs/screenshots/en/05-stems-panel.png)

One click splits any saved track into 4 isolated stems (Demucs `htdemucs`), with a progress bar, a separate player and download per stem, and the option to redo or delete. Runs alongside the active generation model (without stopping it), sharing a GPU lock. The **"Open in editor"** button allows you to instantly send all 4 stems into a new built-in DAW project for further mixdown.

## MIDI transcription (MuScriptor)

![MIDI transcription](docs/screenshots/en/06-midi-panel.png)

Transcribes the full mix, or any already-separated stem, into MIDI. Technically this isn't a separate process — it's a model loaded into the already-running YuE2 server, so **transcription requires YuE2 to be the active model**. Result: a built-in Web Audio synth player, a mini piano roll, a note count and BPM readout, and `.mid` download.

## Built-in DAW

![Editor: a four-stem project on the timeline](docs/screenshots/en/08-editor-with-clip.png)

Any number of tracks, onto which you can add anything from the shared library (a full mix, a single stem, a file uploaded from disk) — via a picker dialog or by dragging a file straight onto a track. The quickest way in is through stems: the **"Open in editor"** button on the stems panel creates a ready-made four-track project (vocals, drums, bass, other).

### Timeline and clips

- Free clip repositioning and edge trimming (non-destructive — the source file is untouched). Clips always snap to neighboring clips' edges and to timeline zero; the **Magnet** button additionally snaps to a grid derived from the project BPM (the step depends on zoom: 1/16, 1/8, 1/4 note, or a bar).
- **Split a clip** at the cursor (`S`), duplicate (`Ctrl+D`), delete (`Delete`).
- Buttons on the clip itself: **M** (mute), **S** (solo), **W** (warp) and ✕. Draggable **fade-in / fade-out** handles sit on the clip's edges; by default each edge gets an automatic 15 ms micro-fade that removes digital clicks from hard cuts.
- **Loop**: a loop region on the time ruler — drag it whole or pull either edge; clicking the ruler seeks.
- **BPM and Warp**: when a clip is added from the library or dragged in from disk, its tempo is detected automatically (from the first 30 seconds). The **BPM** field sets the project tempo, and the **W** button time-stretches the clip to it (SoundTouch) while preserving pitch. The detector is a simple one and can be off on complex material.
- **Undo/Redo** (`Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y`) — up to **30 steps** of history. Zoom with `Ctrl+wheel` or the slider and **Fit** button; pan the timeline with `Shift+drag` or the middle mouse button.

### Channels and effects

![Effects rack on the vocals channel](docs/screenshots/en/10-editor-effects.png)

- Every track has volume, pan, mute/solo, and a color (the dots above the track list), plus a shared master bus.
- **An 8-effect rack** on every channel and on the master: EQ (Low/Mid/High, ±12 dB), Dynamics (compressor: threshold and ratio), Filter (LP/HP: frequency and resonance), Chorus, Delay, Reverb, Distortion, and Bitcrush. All effects run in real time, with parameter values shown next to the sliders.
- Stereo master VU meters (L/R) in the toolbar, and a level meter with clipping indication in the selected track's channel.

### Help

![Built-in editor help](docs/screenshots/en/11-editor-help.png)

The **"?"** button in the toolbar opens built-in help: a list of hotkeys, mouse controls, and short tips on Loop and Magnet.

### Project and export

- Projects are stored on the server and opened from a list. There is no autosave — use the **Save** button; if you close the tab or navigate away with unsaved edits, the editor warns you about losing them.
- Export the mixed-down project as **WAV** or **MP3** — rendered offline (the same processing graph as live playback) and saved back into the shared track library.

---

## Architecture

- **`backend/`** — FastAPI (Python). `app/orchestrator/` manages the models' process lifecycle (start/stop/health-poll) and enforces their mutual exclusion on a single GPU. `app/api/routes_proxy.py` reverse-proxies `/api/ace/*` → ACE-Step's REST API (port 8001) and `/api/yue2/*` → YuE2's native server (`audiocpp_server.exe`, port 8080). `app/db.py` + `routes_tracks.py` are the shared SQLite database and files, organized per model, regardless of how a track was created (generation, upload, or assembled in the editor).
- **`frontend/`** — Vue 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + Pinia + vue-router + vue-i18n. A fully native implementation (not an iframe) on top of the models' original APIs — `src/audio/` contains its own Web Audio engine (mixer, timeline, effects, a MIDI parser and synth, WAV/MP3 encoders).
- **`desktop/`** — an optional Electron shell and installer: first-run setup, server lifecycle and packaging. It runs the same `backend/` and `frontend/`; see [`desktop/README.md`](desktop/README.md).
- Only the models' own inference process (`acestep-api` and `audiocpp_server.exe`) runs from their original code — everything else (UI, proxying, storage, file upload/transcoding) is written in this repository. YuE2's own web UI (`web-ui/server.py`) is no longer used — the one useful part of it (transcoding non-WAV uploads via ffmpeg) has been ported to `backend/app/api/routes_yue2_upload.py`.

## Built with

Remiqora is a UI and orchestrator on top of third-party inference engines. Their code isn't vendored into this repository — only small functional patches (`external/patches/`) on top of the originals:

| Project | What's used | License |
|---|---|---|
| [ACE-Step-1.5](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step-1.5) | Text/style-driven music generation engine, LoRA training | MIT |
| [audio.cpp](https://github.com/0xShug0/audio.cpp) (`dev` branch) | YuE2 (generation), SheetSage2 (melody extraction), MuScriptor (MIDI transcription) | Apache-2.0 |
| [Demucs](https://github.com/adefossez/demucs) | Stem separation (`htdemucs`) | MIT |

Patch details and exact base commits are in [`external/patches/README.md`](external/patches/README.md).

The desktop app additionally uses [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) (MIT), [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build) (MIT), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (MIT or Apache-2.0) and static FFmpeg builds (GPL) that it downloads on first launch instead of redistributing.

## 📦 Installation

Use a source checkout for this fork. Its scripts and experimental desktop packaging are described below; a complete fresh installation of this snapshot has not been verified on every platform. Use Python 3.12 and Node.js 22.12 or newer. Model setup downloads large third-party engines/weights and is separate from CPU regression tests.

With Git installed, clone the maintained fork and run the following commands from its root:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mchosc/remiqora.git
cd remiqora
```

### Desktop app (experimental)

The source includes an Electron shell with first-run setup for **Windows** (NVIDIA RTX 20-series or newer, driver 580 or newer) and **macOS** (Apple Silicon). Fork packaging uses its own app ID and `Remiqora-mchosc-*` artifact names. There is no published **0.3.0-dev.0** installer; building one locally does not establish platform support.

**Historical upstream downloads (v0.2.1, without this fork's features):** [Windows installer (.exe)](https://github.com/inikolax/remiqora/releases/download/v0.2.1/Remiqora-Setup-0.2.1.exe) · [macOS installer (.dmg, Apple Silicon)](https://github.com/inikolax/remiqora/releases/download/v0.2.1/Remiqora-0.2.1-arm64.dmg) · [upstream files and SHA-256 sums](https://github.com/inikolax/remiqora/releases/tag/v0.2.1)

</p>

- **First launch.** The setup checks the GPU, driver, free disk space and connection, offers a folder for models/projects, and installs audio.cpp, ACE-Step, Demucs, weights and FFmpeg. Upstream reported roughly 30 GB of downloads and 35 GB on disk on Windows; the setup asks for 50 GB free. These are historical estimates, not measurements of this fork's full installation.
- **Every launch after that.** The app starts the server and opens the interface. Closing the window stops the model servers and frees the GPU.
- **Where things live.** The default data root is still `Remiqora`, even though the fork's desktop app identity and saved setup preferences are separate. An upstream custom-folder choice does not transfer automatically: after backup, explicitly select that existing folder, or choose a separate folder for testing. **Do not run the upstream app and fork against the same library at once.** Use the Settings data-folder migration workflow when changing storage; do not move database files by hand.

**Status.** Experimental and unsigned. A local installer build may trigger Windows/macOS security prompts. Fork release candidates require the manual platform and migration checks in [fork maintenance](docs/fork-maintenance.md). To build locally:

```sh
cd frontend && npm ci && cd ../desktop && npm ci
npm run dist    # output: desktop/dist/Remiqora-mchosc-*; build macOS packages on a Mac
```

[`desktop/README.md`](desktop/README.md) covers what the first run installs, the test switches and the known gaps.

**What it is built with.** An [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) shell around the web UI and FastAPI backend, packaged with [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build). First-run setup uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [audio.cpp](https://github.com/0xShug0/audio.cpp) release binaries and static FFmpeg builds. Their licenses and model-weight terms remain separate from this fork's MIT license.

### Install from scripts

The steps below install from scripts instead: Git, a terminal and, on Windows, the build tools.

### Step 0: build tools

```cmd
setup_prereqs.bat
```

Via `winget` (built into Windows 10/11), installs Git, Python, `uv`, Node.js,
CMake, ffmpeg, plus Visual Studio Build Tools (C++ workload) and the CUDA
Toolkit — those are large, need admin rights, and can take a while.
`setup_prereqs.bat -SkipHeavy` installs only the small, fast tools, leaving
Build Tools/CUDA for you to install manually from links the script prints.

**The NVIDIA GPU driver is deliberately left out** — install it by hand from
[nvidia.com/drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers) for your card: silently
swapping a video driver on someone else's machine is risky (it can blank the
screen and usually needs a reboot on your schedule, not the script's).

After installing, close the terminal and open a new one so PATH picks up the
freshly installed tools.

**On macOS (Apple Silicon):**
```sh
./setup_prereqs.sh
```
Via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), installs Git, Python, `uv`, Node.js, CMake,
ffmpeg and Ninja. No separate GPU driver step: Metal is built into macOS.
CMake/Ninja are only actually used by the `--from-source` build path below —
the default YuE2 setup needs no compiler at all.

### Step 1: generation engines

```cmd
setup_models.bat
```

The script:
1. Clones `ace-step/ACE-Step-1.5` (MIT) and `0xShug0/audio.cpp` (Apache-2.0,
   `dev` branch — YuE2 support is dev-only for now) into `external/`.
2. Applies a small patch to ACE-Step (a task-cancellation API; audio.cpp
   needs no patch, see `external/patches/README.md`) — without the upstream
   custom web-uis, which aren't needed.
3. Runs `uv sync` for ACE-Step and builds `audiocpp_server` (CUDA release,
   `yue2,sheetsage2,muscriptor` models) for audio.cpp.
4. Downloads the YuE2/SheetSage2/MuScriptor GGUF weights (~10 GB) via
   audio.cpp's `tools/model_manager_v2.py`.
5. Sets up a `demucs` uv project in `external/Demucs` for stem separation,
   routed at PyTorch's cu128 wheel index so it gets a CUDA build (a plain
   `uv add demucs` would silently resolve a CPU-only torch wheel instead).
6. Creates `backend/.env` with paths to the freshly cloned repositories,
   including `FFMPEG_BIN_DIR` — auto-detected from `ffmpeg`'s winget install
   (`setup_prereqs.bat`), even right after installing it in the same
   terminal, before a new one would pick it up on PATH.

ACE-Step's own weights don't need a separate download — `acestep-api` pulls
them from HuggingFace/ModelScope on first request, the same way its Gradio
UI does.

The script is idempotent — safe to re-run (the `-SkipBuild` / `-SkipWeights`
flags skip the corresponding steps). It expects `git`,
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), Python 3,
CMake, the CUDA Toolkit and Visual Studio Build Tools (C++ workload) to
already be installed — if any is missing, that step is simply skipped with a
hint on what to install.

After that, the only manual step left is checking `CUDA_BIN_DIR` in
`backend/.env` (`FFMPEG_BIN_DIR` is filled in automatically — unless ffmpeg
wasn't found at all, in which case the script says so and it needs setting
by hand).

Hard machine requirements the script can't remove: Windows, a CUDA-capable
NVIDIA GPU, and an installed video driver. Upstream reported an RTX 4080
16 GB run; this fork's Windows/GPU installation still needs verification.

**On macOS (Apple Silicon):**
```sh
./setup_models.sh
```
Adapted for macOS, with one difference from the Windows steps above: by
default, `audiocpp_server` is installed from audio.cpp's own **prebuilt
macOS/Metal release** (a pinned tag, sha256-verified before extracting) —
no compiler needed at all, unlike the Windows path, which always builds
from source since there's no prebuilt CUDA release. The Demucs uv project
also isn't routed at a CUDA wheel index — a plain `torch` dependency
already resolves an MPS-capable wheel on darwin/arm64, same as
ACE-Step-1.5's own `pyproject.toml` does. The written `backend/.env` has no
`CUDA_BIN_DIR` — there's no CUDA toolkit on this path.

Pass `--from-source` to build audio.cpp from the same pinned `dev` commit
Windows uses instead of downloading the release (useful if the release lags
behind a `dev`-only fix, or on Intel Macs, which the prebuilt asset doesn't
cover) — that path needs full **Xcode.app** (not just the Command Line
Tools) for its Metal shader compiler; `setup_prereqs.sh` prints exact steps
if it's missing. `--skip-build` / `--skip-weights` mirror `-SkipBuild` /
`-SkipWeights`. Otherwise it expects `git`, `uv` and Python 3 to already be
installed (`cmake` too, for `--from-source`).

Hard machine requirements this path can't remove: macOS, Apple Silicon
(M-series) for the default prebuilt path (Intel needs `--from-source`).
Upstream reported a MacBook Air, Apple M5, 24 GB RAM run — including a from-scratch run
against a machine with no prior Homebrew packages or project state, all the
way through generating audio with YuE2 on the Metal backend. This is not
verification of a clean installation of this fork.
This path is newer and less exercised than the Windows/CUDA one — expect it
to be slower (Metal instead of CUDA). `--from-source` in particular may
need occasional manual fixing up (a bumped commit pin) if audio.cpp's `dev`
branch drifts upstream; the default release-based path is pinned to a fixed
tag instead, so it doesn't drift on its own.

**On Linux (NVIDIA CUDA):**
```sh
./setup_linux.sh
```
Builds audio.cpp with its native Linux CUDA backend, installs ACE-Step and Demucs in isolated environments, downloads the model weights, and writes `backend/.env`. It expects git, Python 3.11/3.12, uv, Node.js 20.19+ (or 22.12+), npm, CMake, ffmpeg, and a CUDA toolkit with nvcc plus cuBLAS/cuFFT development headers. The NVIDIA driver is deliberately not installed or modified.

Tool paths are overrideable (`UV_BIN`, `NODE_BIN`, `NPM_BIN`, `CMAKE_BIN`, `NVCC_BIN`, `CUDA_TOOLKIT_PREFIX`, `CUDA_LIB_DIR`). On multi-GPU hosts, `ACE_STEP_DEVICE=0 YUE2_DEVICE=1 ./setup_linux.sh` pins the engines separately and enables concurrent model residency when the two explicit device values differ; leave either value unset (or set both to the same device) to retain the default exclusive switching behavior. Upstream reported Ubuntu 24.04/WSL2 NVIDIA CUDA verification; fresh fork installation and other Linux platforms remain unverified.

### Step 2: run

Launchers install backend dependencies only when creating the virtualenv. **For an existing checkout, refresh dependencies before restarting:** on Windows, `backend\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r backend\requirements.txt`; on macOS/Linux, `backend/.venv/bin/python3 -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`. Run `npm ci` in `frontend/` after dependency changes.

```cmd
dev.bat
```
Brings up the backend (port 9000) and the frontend with Hot Module Replacement (Vite, port 5173), creates `backend/.venv` and `frontend/node_modules` on first run, and opens a browser at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

For production mode — build the SPA and serve everything from a single port:
```cmd
prod_run.bat
```
Builds the client via `npm run build` and serves the finished SPA bundle together with the API at [http://127.0.0.1:9000](http://127.0.0.1:9000).

Stem separation's `demucs` uv project is set up by `setup_models.bat` above; the `htdemucs` weights themselves download automatically on first use.

**On Linux:** `./prod_run_linux.sh` builds the frontend and serves the SPA and API on `127.0.0.1:9000` by default. Override with `REMIQORA_HOST` / `REMIQORA_PORT`. To opt in to LAN access, run `REMIQORA_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./prod_run_linux.sh`; Remiqora has no built-in authentication, so only expose it on a trusted network or behind an authenticated reverse proxy.

**On macOS:** `./dev.sh` and `./prod_run.sh` are the equivalents — same
behavior, except the backend/frontend run as background jobs of the script
itself (stop both with Ctrl+C) rather than in separate terminal windows.

**Linux development:** use two terminals from the checkout: `cd backend && ./run.sh`, and `cd frontend && npm ci && npm run dev`. Open `http://localhost:5173` yourself; `dev.sh` uses macOS's `open` command. Both development and bundled launchers bind the backend to loopback by default.

## Audio versions and Settings

The header's **Settings** page configures MP3 CBR/VBR, WAV bit depth, FLAC compression, sample rate/channels and the Data folder. Defaults affect future exports; queued and completed files keep their captured settings.

Saved track cards offer **Audio versions** for original/cloned playback and **Voices & exports** for additional cloned voices and MP3/WAV/FLAC downloads. Selecting a completed format plays and downloads that exact file. Each voice uses the retained original, and earlier versions remain available. Older missing originals cannot be reconstructed. Each saved track has a persistent star; **Favorites only** combines with date filters and sorting. See [audio export quality](docs/audio-export-quality.md) for defaults, source-quality limits and recovery behavior.

## ⚙ Configuration (.env)

Settings live in `backend/.env` (template: `backend/.env.example`;
`setup_models.bat` creates it automatically with paths to the cloned repositories):
```ini
ACE_STEP_DIR=E:\AI\ACE\ACE-Step-1.5
YUE2_DIR=E:\AI\YuE2-3B
DEMUCS_DIR=E:\AI\Demucs
FFMPEG_BIN_DIR=E:\AI\ACE\tools\ffmpeg-shared\ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl-shared\bin
CUDA_BIN_DIR=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v13.4\bin
```

- `ACE_STEP_DIR` — root of the cloned and patched ACE-Step-1.5.
- `YUE2_DIR` — root of the cloned and patched audio.cpp (where `audiocpp_server.exe` is built and the YuE2/SheetSage2/MuScriptor GGUF weights live).
- `DEMUCS_DIR` — root of the `demucs` uv project used for stem separation.
- `FFMPEG_BIN_DIR` — folder containing `ffmpeg.exe`/`ffprobe.exe`.
- `CUDA_BIN_DIR` — the `bin` folder of the installed CUDA Toolkit (needs to be on PATH for `audiocpp_server.exe`). Windows only — on macOS this is left unset, since YuE2 runs on the Metal backend instead.

## Known limitations

- ACE-Step and YuE2 switch exclusively by default. On multi-GPU Linux hosts, explicitly setting both `ACE_STEP_DEVICE` and `YUE2_DEVICE` to different device values opts into concurrent residency and pins each engine to its own GPU.
- MIDI transcription requires YuE2 specifically to be active (the MuScriptor model loads into its process).
- Windows (NVIDIA CUDA), macOS/Apple Silicon (Metal/MPS), and Linux x86_64 (NVIDIA CUDA) have setup/run paths — `.bat`/`.ps1` scripts for the first, `.sh` scripts for the other two. Linux is community-contributed: it builds audio.cpp from source and needs a CUDA development toolkit in addition to the driver, and has been verified end-to-end on Ubuntu 24.04 (via WSL2 with GPU passthrough) rather than on bare metal or other distros.
- The desktop installers are experimental: unsigned (a SmartScreen or Gatekeeper prompt), and the first launch downloads roughly 30 GB. The installer does not support Linux yet — Linux users run from source via `setup_linux.sh`.
- The macOS/Metal path is newer and less battle-tested than the Windows/CUDA one; expect it to be slower. By default it installs a prebuilt YuE2 binary pinned to a fixed release tag (no compiler needed); `--from-source` instead builds the same `dev` commit Windows uses, and may occasionally need that pin bumped if `dev` drifts.
